# Machine Learning in R
This repository gathers machine learning algorithms in R language implemented during courses.

***

## Installation 
These algorithms were coded in R language using the IDE ***Rstudio***
If you want to download the latest version of the IDE, click on the   following link : [https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4).  
Furthermore many packages are needed for the implementation of algorithms, they are specified in every files.
